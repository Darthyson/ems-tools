EMS-Tools
(c) 2014 by Michael Moosbauer

This is a bunch of tools and includes needed to conveniently implement
a webinterface for controlling a Buderus EMS heating system interfaced
with a ems-collector daemon.

For installation, see INSTALL.

This work relies heavily of the ems-collector written by
Danny Baumann. Thanks to him for his excellent work.

NOTE: This version is NOT designed to be made available in the
      public internet! PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT ALL FILES ARE
      ONLY ACCESSIBLE IN YOUR LOCAL NETWORK OR IN A PASSWORD-
      PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT!
      Otherwise any bad guy will be able to reconfigure your
      heating system!!
