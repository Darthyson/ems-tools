This is a bunch of tools and includes needed to conveniently implement 
a webinterface for controlling a Buderus EMS heating system interfaced 
with a ems-collector daemon.

This work relies heavily on the ems-collector software written by 
Danny Baumann. Thanks to him for his excellent work.

NOTE: This version is NOT designed to be made available in the 
      public internet! PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT ALL FILES ARE
      ONLY ACCESSIBLE IN YOUR LOCAL NETWORK OR IN A PASSWORD-
      PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT! 
      Otherwise any bad guy will be able to reconfigure your
      heating system!!

Installation is not straightforward, as you need an PHP enabled
local webserver. Some experience with PHP-based websites is 
highly recommended.

You need:

1. A working recent ems-collector daemon. It is assumed that
   its control port is 7777 and its data port is 7778.
   This is accomplished by the following startup options
   (see /etc/default/ems-collector):

    -C 7777 -D 7778 

   You can cat the latest source of the modified ems-collector at
   https://github.com/moosy/ems-collector.
   NOTE: You need the master branch!
   Get it with:

   git clone https://github.com/moosy/ems-collector


2. A working PHP environment with access to your EMS-mysql-database.
   Note:
   Make sure, that the following PHP-modules are available:
      posix
      pcntl
      shmop
   Install them with your OS package manager, if needed.

3. IMPORTANT: Set a symlink from /emsincludes/ to the includes-Subdir
   of this distribution, e.g. by 
     ln -s /path/to/ems-tools/includes /emsincludes/

4. Adjust ALL config.* files in the includes-dir to suit your needs.

5. Now start the ems-cached.php file as a service. You can adapt the 
   included init script example (based on an openSuSE system) for your
   needs.

6. Start the emsclient in the CLI-Subdir. Type 
     help <enter>.
   If you see a list of available commands, that's very good.
   Now try 
     req uba <enter>
   You should get a list of UBA-specific data. If you see that too,
   everything is fine.

7. TROUBLESHOOTING: 
   If it does not work, check:
   - if the collector runs, and you can telnet to port 7777 and issue
     commands (e.g. help)
   - if you can telnet to port 7778 and you receive periodically 
     clear-text-data
   - if you succeed until now, the collector works.
   - now telnet to 7779, and enter getdata <enter>. you should get
     a list similar to that from port 7778. If this succeeds, the
     cache-daemon works.
   - Double check all the config.* files in your /emsincludes/ dir
     (you set the symlink, didn't you?)
